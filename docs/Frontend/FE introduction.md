# Front-end Introduction

This section provides an overview of the front-end architecture and tools used for the "RaiseHub" project. It covers the technologies, development practices, and structure of the front-end codebase, along with instructions for setting up the development environment.

## Overview

The front-end of the "RaiseHub" application is a Single-Page Application (SPA) built using modern web development frameworks and libraries. It provides an intuitive interface for users to create, fund, and manage projects. The goal is to deliver a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

The front-end is built using the following technologies:
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture makes it easier to manage complex UIs.
- **React Router**: Enables client-side routing to create a multi-page feel within a single-page application.
- **TailwindCSS** (choose the one you use): For styling the user interface. It provides pre-built components and styles that speed up development.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the back-end API.

## Project Structure

The codebase follows a modular structure, organized into different folders:
- **`components/`**: Contains reusable UI components such as buttons, forms, and cards.
- **`app/`**: Includes the main views or screens, such as Home, Project Details, and User Dashboard.
- **`public/`**: Stores most of the images of the page(not individual project images)

## Development Setup

To get started with the front-end development, follow these steps:
